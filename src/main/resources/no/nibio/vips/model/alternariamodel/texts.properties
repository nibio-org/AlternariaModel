name=TOMCAST (FAST - Dew) model
description=TODO

statusInterpretation=The model's warning status will be green (no infection risk) until the accumulated risk value is 5 points below the threshold value that signifies an infection risk. From that value and until the threshold value is exceeded, the warning will be yellow (possible infection risk), and above that, the warning status will be red (high infection risk).
usage=Description of required input parameters:\n\
timeZone - What timezone the calculation is for. Necessary to calculate daily values from the provided hourly values. \
See this list of time zones: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones (Column "TZ")\n\
observations - list of weather data. The following parameters are required:\n\
* TM - Average temperature (Degrees Celcius)\n\
* BT - Leaf wetness (Minutes/hour) (IF you don't have leaf wetness, you must provide UM (relative humidity). Then we will calculate the leaf wetness.\n\
sprayingDate - (Optional) Farmers can choose multiple spraying dates (upto four spraying dates).
